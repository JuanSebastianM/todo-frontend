# General information

This is the front-end code of a todo-list app whose development is detailed in an article called [Build a Full Stack CRUD App With GraphQL, MongoDB, NextJS, NextAuth, and TypeScript](https://juansebastian.hashnode.dev/build-a-full-stack-crud-app-with-graphql-mongodb-nextjs-nextauth-and-typescript) published on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/). 

Having said that, it is important to understand that this project is only for educational purposes and is not intended to be used on production, mainly because this side of the app was developed with some experimental features.
